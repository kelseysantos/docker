iDRAC7 Enterprise crack keygen
(This will change your Dell service tag, you won't get iDRAC7 enterprise without having this service tag, 9QYZF42)
 
find and download "OMSA71-CentOS6-x86_64-LiveDVD.iso". It must be this older version, newer versions replaced a tool we want with a dumbed down version.
 
Boot into it from the server and launch gnome-terminal
run these commands
su
smbios-sys-info --service-tag --set=9QYZF42
reboot
 
You may notice some "upgrading" screens. This is normal
Once the system is booted log into the iDRAC
 
Your new service tag should be updated to 9QYZF42
Open your favorite file editor and create a new XML file with the contents at the bottom of the page, starting at <?xml...
Load this file as a license in your iDRAC, log out, and back in.
 
You now have iDRAC7 enterprise!
 
Since iDRAC authenticates using your service tag, if you go back, the license will revert to idrac basic.
This obviously isn't a solution for business because duplicate service tags will cause big problems on your network during deployment, and if somebody decides to call in for service.
 
This isn't a terrible idea for the average homelabber though.
